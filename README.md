# Work Day Scheduler

This application allows you to schedule and save hourly events. The events are recalled even if the window is closed. Events are updated if a new event is entered. The time of the day is notated at the top, and the rows are colored according to time. Rows in the past are colored gray, rows in the future are colored green, and the row of the current hour is colored green.
